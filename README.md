# LangByFolder
This tool can help you understand complex folder structures (code repositories, image and video galeries) without having to manually iterate them manually.

It detects most common programming lanugage extensions, image and video formats

Currently the output is a CSV file but a User interface is planned

For each folder the list of extensions contained in them is show from most common to less common, or alphabetically (you decide)

There are columns that detect files typically used for unit testing, or files that seem to be services
